Scam (Stereo Camera)
====================

A few boilerplate projects to get started with anaglyph stero-pair rendering in Processing.

1. Simple stereo camera example 
   ![scam_1](images/scam_1)

2. Stereo camera example with common renderer   
   ![scam_2](images/scam_2)

3. Shader example to combine stereoscopic pictures
   ![scam_3](images/scam_3)


Anaglyph (etymology)
--------------------

From Ancient Greek ἀναγλυφή (anagluphḗ, “work in low relief”); from ana- up + glyphein carve out

Noun
Anaglyph (plural anaglyphs)

1. A decorative ornament worked in low relief or bas relief, such as a piece of cameo jewelry.

2. A matched pair of images designed to produce a three-dimensional effect when viewed using spectacles that have usually one red and one bluish-green lens, corresponding to the colors of the pairs of images.
